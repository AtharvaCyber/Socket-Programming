# Socket-Programming

Socket programming is a computer networking concept that allows communication between two devices over a network using sockets. A socket is a programming interface and communication endpoint that enables data exchange between two nodes.

In socket programming, one device acts as a server, while the other acts as a client. The server waits for incoming connections from clients, and the client establishes a connection with the server to initiate communication. Once the connection is established, both the server and client can send and receive data.
